## Requirements

1. Using a timing method of your choice get a baseline time for the unmodified code to compute the angular distances.
2. Multi-thread this application using pthreads.
3. Determine the optimal number of threads, 2, 4, 10, 25, 100, and 1000, for calculating the minimum, maximum, and mean angular distance on your codespace. 
4. Add the command line parameter -t to allow the user to specify the number of threads to use.
5. The code must not deadlock or exhibit any race conditions.
6. The code must still calculate the same answer as the single-threaded application.
7. You must include a report documenting your results. It must contain:
- A brief executive summary/ overview
- A description of your effort to include which libraries, if any, you used, and the reasons you chose your timing methods.
- Results in both graph and table form.
- A discussion of any anomalies you found in the resulting data.
- A conclusion explaining the optimal number of threads.
- The report must be in PDF form and submitted to your repository. Any other format will not be accepted.
